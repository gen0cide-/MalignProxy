MalignProxy
-----------
A couple of years ago I wrote ProxMon (http://www.isecpartners.com/proxmon.html).
ProxMon was written in Python and relied on a third party proxy (WebScarab was
recommented).  I started on a rewrite in Ruby back in early 2008, but didn't get
far due to other commitments.

The poc directory contains various proof of concept code:
poc/httplog.rb:
- Trivial HTTP proxy that just logs requests in the standard WebScarab format

poc/sslmitm.rb
- SSL MITM proxy.  Can be used with Firefox if you import the CA it creates
  in the CA subdirectory.

poc/quickcert.rb
- Needed by sslmitm.  From http://segment7.net/projects/ruby/QuickCert/
